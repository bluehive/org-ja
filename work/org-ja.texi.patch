  just one subtree.  @orgcmd{C-c C-x b,org-tree-to-indirect-buffer} Show the

Editing the indirect buffer will also change the original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that buffer.}.  With a numeric
  prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N is
  negative then go up that many levels.  With a @kbd{C-u} prefix, do not
  remove the previously used indirect buffer.
